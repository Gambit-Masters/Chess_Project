# Chess_Project

## Notes
>### [Chess Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess)
When forking the files, make sure that the directory for the dataset, "games.csv", matches with your dataset or does not interfere with the dataset that you may have already downloaded if it has been modified.

Additionally, depending on where you run your Python programs:
- Using VScode: unsure how to run it. But I do believe in the terminal you would type `python app.py`
- Using PyCharm: run `app.py`
